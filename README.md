# CHAS Clinic Finder

## Project Summary

### Project Context
The _CHAS Clinic Finder_ is an interactive map developed to allow its users to easily search for CHAS clinics around Singapore. CHAS refers to Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). Under this scheme, eligible citizens would be able to receive subsidized healthcare treatments in the participating clinic outlets.

### Organisational Goals
The app aims to provide a service to ease the process of users in their search for CHAS clinics through filtering out clinics that are not associated with CHAS.

### User Goals
The aim of users is to obtain subsidized healthcare services. The app seeks to help users achieve their needs by providing a quick and user-friendly map to locate nearby CHAS clinic.

### Justification for the App
While there are location information of CHAS clinic online, the format in which the information are currently presented is not user-friendly (e.g. spreadsheet). Such hurdles could create unnecessary frustration especially for users that are seeking for medical attention urgently. As such, having an interactive map that allow users to see all the locations of CHAS clinics at a glance as well as having a built-in search bar could ease the search process.

* The main colour scheme of the app are the different shades of blue as depicted above. 
As the colour blue is often associated with trust and stability, a blue colour scheme was chosen to associate feelings of trust towards the app. In times of emergency (e.g. urgent medical attention is required), it is important that users trust that the app would function properly in helping them search for clinics.
* White font is generally used to contrast with the darker color scheme. This is to make it easier to read for users, where majority are presumed to be in their middle adulthood.
